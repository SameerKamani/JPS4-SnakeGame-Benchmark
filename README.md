# JPS4 Snake & A* Comparison 🐍✨

## About

JPS4 Snake & A* Comparison is a classic Snake game enhanced with AI pathfinding powered by **JPS4 (Jump Point Search for 4-connected grids)**. This project not only showcases efficient real-time movement but also includes a module to compare the JPS4 algorithm against the standard A* algorithm. The goal is to verify research findings, analyze performance metrics, and gain deeper insights into both pathfinding approaches. 🔍🤖

## Overview

This project combines a classic Snake game with a demonstration of **JPS4**—a pathfinding algorithm designed for efficient navigation in 4-connected grid environments. In addition to the game, a dedicated component now compares the performance and results of the JPS4 algorithm with the A\* algorithm to confirm optimality, measure execution time, and evaluate node expansions. 🚀🕹️

## What Is JPS4?

**JPS4** is an adaptation of **Jump Point Search (JPS)** tailored for grids that allow movement only in the four cardinal directions (**up, down, left, right**). The algorithm speeds up the traditional A\* search by "jumping" over unnecessary nodes, significantly reducing the number of expanded nodes while still guaranteeing an optimal path. ⚡➡️

### Key Points of JPS4

- **Canonical Ordering**: Enforces a strict order for expanding movements (e.g., **horizontal-first** or **vertical-first**), which eliminates redundant paths. 🔄
- **Pruning Neighbors**: Selectively expands only those neighbors that are essential for reaching the goal, maintaining optimality while reducing computation. ✂️
- **Jumping Over Empty Space**: Instead of moving step-by-step, JPS4 jumps across open cells until it reaches an obstacle, forced neighbor, or the goal. 🏃‍♂️💨
- **Maintaining Optimality**: Despite skipping nodes, the algorithm ensures the final path remains optimal, matching the results of A\*. ✅

## Why Use JPS4 Over A\*?

- **Performance Gains**: In complex grid environments with many obstacles, JPS4 can significantly reduce the number of nodes evaluated compared to A\*, leading to faster pathfinding. ⚙️💡
- **Guaranteed Optimality**: The algorithm maintains the same optimal path cost as A\* while offering improved efficiency. 🥇

## Comparing JPS4 with A\*

### Motivation for Comparison

This repository now features a module dedicated to comparing the **JPS4** and **A\*** algorithms:
- **Research Verification**: Confirm that JPS4 offers a significant performance boost while still returning optimal paths. 📊🔍
- **Result Dispute**: Validate or challenge previous research by comparing real-time gameplay and test scenarios. 🤔📈

### Comparison Methodology

- **Path Optimality**: Both algorithms compute paths on identical grids, with their path costs compared to ensure JPS4’s results are optimal. ➡️✅
- **Performance Metrics**: Metrics such as execution time and the number of nodes expanded are recorded for both algorithms. ⏱️📉
- **Visual Debugging**: Paths generated by both algorithms can be visually overlaid on the game grid for immediate comparison and debugging. 👀🖼️

### Expected Outcomes

- **Consistent Optimality**: JPS4 should always return the same optimal path as A\*. 🔄
- **Enhanced Performance**: Particularly in environments with many obstacles or open areas, JPS4 is expected to outperform A\* in terms of speed. ⚡🏆
- **Insightful Analysis**: Any discrepancies between the two algorithms provide valuable insights for further optimization. 🤓💬

## How It Relates to the Snake Game

- **AI Pathfinding**: The snake's movement is driven by the JPS4 algorithm, allowing it to rapidly and efficiently reach its food targets. 🍏➡️🐍
- **Real-Time Efficiency**: The optimized pathfinding ensures that the game remains responsive and engaging, even as paths are recalculated every game tick. ⏳🎮
- **Algorithm Comparison for Research**: The inclusion of the A\* comparison module deepens the research aspect of the project, providing a clear analysis of the benefits and limitations of each algorithm. 📚🧪
